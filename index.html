Good King Sobik of House Stiedry, struck dead at forty-nine years. His reign was a troubled one.","","Whether he deserved to go out in a carriage ambush is something you haven't yet decided. You have no love for the late king, your father, not since what he and your \"mother\" did to you. Not one tear fell from your eyes.","","However, the past feels distant now as the wind whips across your face. Your mount struggles beneath you from the long and painful trip. You've ridden as fast as you could, ahead of the rest of the bodyguards, desperate to inform the royal family of the grim news.","","Now, your journey is at an end. You and your mount bound up a final hill, quickly dodging a peasant's cart as you reach the top. Squinting from the bright, late-summer sun, you take in the great walled fortress city of Wrido, the capital of the crown.","","It has been a long time since you last went on a forced march. The breakneck pace you set was painful but bearable. At least for you. Your poor mount, weighed down by you and your full kit stowed across his body, looks like he's at death's door.","","As you inhale the hot summer air and feel the familiar ache of a body at march, a pang of nostalgia hits you.","","[i]It has truly been too long,[/i] you think.","","*page_break","You drive your tired mount further and further, charging through the city's open gates. You dodge past startled peasants and wave off guardsmen as you bolt through the streets.","","Wrido is a large town, but one you know like the back of your hand.

It stands there, just past the gates of the citadel, unable to move any further. With a weary sigh, you dismount, give it a small word of thanks, and sling your bag over your shoulder.","","Gazing up, you take in the palace before you. It is quite a sight, you do admit.

Best not to draw their gaze.","","Finally, you reach Elya, who's leaning against the wall, arms folded. Her eyes are tilted down, and she doesn't see you approaching.","","It's been nearly half a year since you last spoke with Elya in any capacity.

In its place, a large smile spreads across her face.","","\"${name}!\" she cries out, and you cringe, placing a finger over your lips, signaling for her to be quiet. You take a brief scan of the room, noting those who have turned toward the two of you.","","\"Keep quiet,\" you practically hiss, and her expression turns to concern.","","\"Are you okay?\" she asks.","","You nod. \"I'm fine. I just don't have much time.\"","","\"O-okay,\" she replies, disappointed. \"But I haven't seen you in months!

You continue, \"Mira didn't wanna tell you, sayin' she didn't want you to cry or somethin' to that effect. But it's not good. I believe we're goin' to war.\"","","Her voice is a hoarse whisper. \"Oh.\"","","You add, with as much gentleness as you can muster, \"I [i]am[/i] truly sorry.\"","","You know that Elya was much closer to your father than you ever could be. While you grieve little at Sobik's death, you do feel sympathy for Elya. The loss of a loved one is painful, and you know that Elya is affected more than others by such things.","","Much more than you, at any rate.","","Elya's reaction to grief is not out-of-control sobbing, but more shock and silent tears, a fact you find yourself grateful for. She gives you another small nod and quietly says, \"Th-thank you.\"","","You return the small nod, and then realize your mission is over. You were so obsessed, so focused on your one goal that you hadn't considered an exit strategy. Giving it thought, you think you might be able to sneak back out the front door.","","But your thoughts are scattered by a voice behind you. \"${name}! What the hell are you doing?\"","","*page_break","You freeze, and Elya goes wide-eyed. You silently beckon for her to move away before the situation escalates. She shuffles back slightly, and you turn around slowly and deliberately.","","Your fears are confirmed. Mira is practically running toward you, a look of rage on her face. Belos and Vedran have stood up from their location at the head of the table, confused at the queen consort herself running and cursing.","","The music stops and the whispers die down as everyone stares at the situation unfolding in front of them. Besides the sound of Mira's frantic footsteps, it is perfectly silent.","","When Mira stops, her face is hardly a foot from your own. You tense up, watching someone so hostile approach so close to you. In a lower tone, a notch below shouting, she continues. \"I told you not to speak with her!\"","","Everyone is staring at the scene unfolding. The scene you are a part of.","","*fake_choice","\t#\"Is there a problem, Your Highness?\" you reply, feigning ignorance.","\t\tMira's face twitches. \"You tell me.

Her expression softens at this comment, but it quickly hardens once more, as","\t#\"I know,\" you reply, deadpan.","\t\tMira is caught completely off guard by your blunt response. After recomposing,","she turns to Elya, and in a jarringly sweet voice, asks, \"Dear, what did ${name} tell you?\"","","Elya shoots you a wide-eyed glance, and you can already tell the outcome before it even happens. Elya has been barely holding grief in silence. She hesitates, then opens her mouth to respond. Then, just as you expected, she lets out a small sob as tears run down her cheeks.","","Mira turns to you with fire in her eyes. In an ice-cold voice with each syllable drawn out, she states, \"You told her.\"","","At this, a new ripple of whispers spreads throughout the spectators, and you become keenly aware of your predicament. [i]Surrounded\u2026[/i] your brain provides unhelpfully.","","She raises a hand to her face, slowly runs it across, then says to the guardsmen, \"Take ${him} back to ${his} guest room.\"","","You can sense the ripple of hesitation that spreads over the guards. Technically, they have no obligation to follow the orders of a queen consort, but know that Mira has incredible sway over King Sobik. Refusing such an order could be bad for them once Sobik returns.","","But he won't.","","But they don't know that.","","None of them do\u2026","","Their apprehension melts, and you can only watch as a rough circle of four guards assembles around you, wielding spears and shields. The ring of spectators remains, turning this into what could almost be described as a betting ring. The whispers grow in intensity. Mira pulls Elya off to the side, but stays to watch the show. Elya stands there, still stricken mute from grief.","","*comment COMBAT SCENES GONNA KILL ME. I GOTTA ACCOUNT FOR: STLYE, HEIGHT, INTIMDIATION, AND IF THE MC HAS WEAPON PROFENCICY.

Today, you stand atop the outermost wall of the fortress city. A fortress city that has stood above these plains for ages, predating even Kanton itself.","","The late summer sun blazes the fury of its dying season, baking the ground dry. Such dry ground makes it exceptionally easy to spot approaching caravans or parties.","","Small plumes of dust accompany individual riders as they set out to and fro, marring the otherwise green and rolling plains of central Kanton. From such a high vantage point, you can see for miles. Pockets of trees and small lakes occasionally break up the landscape.","","Most of the wildlife besides the mice or domestic animals live in these small pockets of cover. Hunting parties make their way to these lucrative pockets to find their prey.","","Farmland, abundant with planted crop bound for harvest come autumn, is scattered all across the plains. Some estates hug the walls of Wrido, vying for the protection of its shadow, while others stay far away, avoiding the attention and danger a city, no less the capital, may bring.","","Stradford, the land of the crown in Kanton, is a quaint province. Idyllic, peaceful, and in its own simple way, beautiful.","","*fake_choice","\t#You long for such peace.","\t\tMaybe peace would quell your inner turmoil.","\t#You hate it.

The farther south you go, the worse the conditions get. The trees grow higher and higher until they eclipse the sun itself when viewed from inside the choking forests. The vegetation grows thick and low, every step touching some variety of plant. If one is unlucky, the plant will be poisonous.","","And the bugs. The vast swarms of gnats, flies, and the accursed mosquito, fly through the air, barely kept at bay by the light of a fire.","","But fire is a rarity inside the soaked forests. If one can break through the trees and see the sky, they will find no sun. Only the black clouds that pour rain down upon the lands, soaking what was already soaked.","","Such bad conditions breed hardy people.

While they both are beautiful from afar, the sun actually shines in the east. The same could hardly be said for the southwest.","","You remember how much Rade cursed when he first lost a boot to the mud. Though he adapted quickly. Faster than you had. Even though you were battling the Erians for a whole year before Rade showed up, he was weathering the rough terrain in two months at the most.","","The way he fought was asymmetrical.","","He met the Erian warbowmen with the might and tactical flexibility of the Krorid Rangers.

Not many walk the streets. Most noise comes from behind the walls of houses or from rowdy taverns. Though the night is peaceful, it does make you uneasy. Despite being in casual clothes, you feel naked. You have no sword. However, your dagger's weight in your shoe brings you some comfort.","","Darin, even in the dark, navigates the streets easily. Though you do notice his limp slows him down quite significantly, and he's moving beyond comfort to keep pace with you. You slow down a bit for him, and he gives you a small, appreciative nod.","","He leads the two of you down many winding streets in a brief fifteen-minute walk. The two of you move in relative silence, broken only by the occasional sarcastic remark.","","Darin's coin purse audibly jingles. You wonder just how drunk he's willing to get.","","Finally, you head around a final street corner and end up in front of a modest structure. You squint to read the name of the establishment but can't in the dim torchlight. The building, at least from the outside, looks well-maintained, and you spot nothing particularly wrong with it.","","You can hear the sounds of men, merrily singing drinking songs. You can already smell the alcohol from outside the place. As you near the door, you hear the singing grow louder and louder.","","Darin turns to you with a mad grin. \"Welcome to the Huntsman's Respite. Best ale in all of Stradford, I's say.\"","","\"What's with the name?\" you ask.","","\"Well, most'a the guys 'ere are huntsmen. Some of the best men I's ever met. And hot damn, do they know how to [i]drink[/i].\"","","The singing swells up further, reaching a crescendo, then rapidly calming down into silence. It's then replaced by boisterous laughter, cheers, and enthusiastic clapping.","","\"Sounds like it,\" you say back.","","\"Yup. Wait 'til you see inside,\" Darin says, then grabs your hand. You tense up, but he ignores it and pulls you forward. \"Speakin' of which, how 'bout we enter now.\" It's phrased like a question, but it's clear Darin isn't going to listen to you.","","He uses his other arm to push the door open. The smell of ale grows. Darin enters and quickly tugs you inside.","","[i]Fuck.[/i]","*page_break ","","As you and Darin enter, the smell grows even further. Alcohol and sweat. It's gross, but not as bad as some other taverns you've been in. At least it doesn't smell like piss.","","The low thatch ceiling is held up by wooden beams that go across the whole structure. The place is dimly lit by a few scattered torches and candles, though you know your eyes will eventually adjust.","","Circular tables are dotted everywhere, stools and chairs pulled up to them. It's crowded. You can spot only a few unoccupied tables. Stools are pulled up to a front counter, where all of them are still taken. Two bartenders attend to the needs of the crowd. An older woman, maybe in her late fifties, moves from table to table, taking orders and offering refills.","","The atmosphere is outstandingly merry. Judging by the amount of ale being passed around, there must be some sort of celebration.","*if (gender = \"male\")","\tBesides the old server, the crowd is made up entirely of men.

The rest appear to be huntsmen, judging by the few that still have a quiver or blade strapped to them.","","They're a mixed bunch. Some are around Darin's age, others are younger than you. But the unifying factor is how strong they all appear to be. The romanticized appearance of archers is that they're slender, graceful, and agile.","","That image is incorrect. The practice required to become proficient with a bow builds muscle.

The two of you sit down in one of the few unoccupied tables left, engulfed in the noise of the place.","","A jumble of conversations and laughs practically deafens you. Instinctively, you start to reach under the table, resting your hand on your hip. Darin notices the tension in your arms and says, \"Easy, Marshal, don't go stabbin' anybody.\"","","Your face remains impassive and scanning, looking out for threats. \"Easy,\" he continues. \"Just try and relax, ay?\"","","*if (gender = \"female\")","\tMany of your neighbors stare at you and whisper among themselves.

And just fuckin' relax, why don't ya?\"","","You sigh and try to relax. \"That's better,\" Darin says, a soft smile on his face.","","Darin turns around on his chair and flags down the old server. She approaches, slinging a towel over her shoulder as she walks. With her other hand, she fiddles around with her coin purse, dropping a handful of silver denari inside.","","With a hand on her hip, she asks, \"What can I getcha, friends?\"","","Darin gestures for you to go first.","","*fake_choice","\t#\"A mug of ale, please.\"","\t\t*temp drink \"ale\"","\t\t\"Of course,\" she replies.","\t#\"Somethin' that burns on the way down.\"","\t\t*temp drink \"strong\"","\t\t\"I'll get ya something strong, then,\" she replies.","\t#\"Somethin' to make me forget.\"","\t\t*temp drink \"strong\"","\t\t\"Of course,\" she replies.

As winter begins its second month, you wonder how much longer the rebels can possibly sustain this siege. Their initial army of twelve thousand has suffered severe losses, now numbering only ${pj_output}.","","*set c3_RebelInfantry + 300","","A small group of around three hundred arrived earlier this morning, carrying with them precious supplies the rebel forces need to maintain their siege. But even with this respite, the enemy will eventually run out of supplies. It's only a matter of time.","","Or so you hope.","","Even their bombardment has died down. The smoking weapons fire less frequently, and with less accuracy. It seems the wetter the months get, the worse their aim becomes. You mentally note this.","","Missed shots fly above the walls, bearing down upon the houses of the poor. More and more cave in, destroyed by balls of solid bronze, smashing into unsuspecting families, mutilating and obliterating.","","You look into the cloudy sky, watching more pure snow pour down from the heavens. It coats the city in its blanket of white. You half-walk, half-trudge through the city streets, passing through the second gatehouse into the outer third of the city.","","The poorer folk live in these parts. They're little above the serfs that live in Kanton's neighboring nations. Kanton considers itself more enlightened than the heathens in the southeast or the Kingdom of Loston in the west, just north of the Krorid jungles.","","You yourself have never been to the supposed \"unenlightened lands\" that still practice serfdom, but the stories you hear are grisly. Men owned by their lords, made to do what they wish at their leisure. The lands where lords practice the \"right of the first night,\" claiming the virginity of lower-class women on their wedding night. A despicable practice.","","And yet Kantonians find no problem forcing women off to be with men they hate. Hypocrisy fills all people.","","Kantonians cry against the system of serfdom, having been freed from it a century before. They play up the atrocities of Loston, sparking animosity between the two kingdoms.","","You're skeptical of these supposed crimes that Loston or the others commit. You've never seen it. You've never met a Lostonian who supports the stories. It may not happen at all, or may be a rare incident blown out of proportion.","","But looking around at the abject poverty of the peasantry, you don't see how serfdom could be much worse.","","They're slaves, in their own way.","*page_break ","","Simple, run-down houses line the streets you walk upon. The air is filled with the sounds of life and death. Orphans and the elderly beg those who pass by for coin or bread. Hounds bark, children laugh, adults talk. Life goes on.","","Even as bodies lie unmoving on doorsteps.","","The shortage of food is evident in the gaunt forms of the young or in the frail dispositions of the adults. The marketplace, once full of bakers or shopkeepers trading foodstuffs and goods, now lies nearly empty. Nobody is willing to trade away their precious food.","","You can only wonder how the rebel army is faring.","","A young man on your right, leaned against the wall of someone's house, keels over to ground, coughing violently. Blood and mucus sprays to the snow, staining it red. This fit lasts for nearly a minute before he looks back up, staring into the sky while shivering.","","You take multiple steps away from this man's side of the road, purposely avoiding him. Bloody, froth-filled lungs choke and gasp, the body going pale and weak. It is more than mere hunger.","","You recognize the signs of the White Death.

You see a pair of riders rush forward, frantically waving something above their head, but the wind blows hard, throwing it back into their faces.","","You squint, confused as to what they might be doing. They're holding a white banner, desperately trying to get the fabric to fly with the wind and be visible. Then you realize just how obvious it is.

They draw their bowstrings back, taking aim at the incoming riders.","","\"Cease!\" you cry, approaching them from the rear. Velinor spins around, and seeing you, he calls over his shoulder, \"Archers, cease!\" Your eyes are drawn toward the group of archers as they return their arrows to their quivers. While not in sync, the motion is impressively smooth, returning to the quiver in just one attempt. Quite professional for only a few months of training.","","You quickly shift your attention to Velinor and\u2026 ","*fake_choice","\t#\u2026shout, \"Are ya fuckin' daft?\"","\t\tThis shout draws some attention from the soldiers around you.

Stay your weapons!\" You reach a damaged portion of the wall and leap, barely clearing the gap where the sharp stones lie below.","","Many of the archers hesitantly lower their weapons. Others, maybe out of bloodlust or disrespect for your command, continue to loose arrows upon the pair of riders. With another curse, you lean back over the battlements, watching as the two turn their steeds and rush in the opposite direction, back toward the encircling camp.","","They hadn't even closed within a hundred yards of the walls. The occasional arrow continues to harass them, until they reach four hundred yards and exceed the range of even the best archers.","","You sigh, leaning against the wall as the last hope of peace fades away.","","[i]Unless\u2026 [/i]","","You have an idea.","*page_break ","","You return to Velinor, who offers you a thumbs-up as you approach.

Lined up against the walls is a grisly sight.","","Bodies, hundreds of them, maybe thousands, litter the fields leading up to the walls. Their bodies sit and jut out of the snow at unnatural angles, their ominous stillness more terrible than if they were moving. Armor, splintered and destroyed, lies buried beneath the snowdrift.","","Faces, torn to shreds by the birds of prey who eat what flesh they can, stare unblinking toward the sky. Others lie face down, having died and drowned in the snow a hundred times over.","","Decay has long since passed its first stages. The bodies have bloated and leaked horrid fluids. The organs have started to liquify. But then winter came.

You can get away with more complicated signals if you have more professional soldiers. If the basic levy doesn't know what the signals mean, you'll also gain an element of surprise. They won't know what to expect.","","When the Ravarians and Kantonian clashed all those centuries ago, the Kantonian army, numerically superior and nearly triple the size, was destroyed under its own weight.

And while it pained you slightly to read the account of an ancient enemy slaughtering your ancestors, you knew the knowledge was too great to pass up out of personal bias.","","And in that dusty old tome you read, a translation of a translation of a translation of a manuscript likely exaggerated to act as propaganda, lies the key to victory.

Better yet, being in a formation with a shield. A comrade to cover your flanks and a shield to cover your center.","","This is why a formation is important. One man can only protect against one angle at a time. You've seen even the best fighters be brought down by a blow from the flanks. However, a group of the best fighters, all covering each other, is nearly unstoppable.","","Nearly.","","The battles you fought at Wrido are the exception to the norm. You watched as both of those fights devolved into chaotic melees where one fought one, sword against axe, and daggers through the eyes.","","Most battles, at least the ones on an open battlefield, are fought by vast formations, jabbing at each other with spears, multiple feet apart.

/* The function needs some explaining.
We want the game to be "refreshable," e.g. on the web.
So we only make a "real" autosave as you click "Next"
But if we do it that way, when we visit the stat screen, it's out of date
So we make a "temp" autosave slot, right as the page finishes redrawing,
and the stat screen uses the "temp" autosave to display your current data.
When you refresh the page, the "temp" autosave is rewritten.

If you save stats on the stat screen, they're written into tempStatWrites;
when the stat screen saves, we transfer tempStatWrites back to the main
game (if the main game is running in a separate iframe, e.g. iOS).

If the main game is about to write the main "" slot, we merge the temp
stat writes into the main stats (and clear the stat writes) before
saving.

Thus, stat changes on the stat screen will only be permanently saved when
the player clicks "Next" in the main game, ensuring that the game is still
refreshable.
